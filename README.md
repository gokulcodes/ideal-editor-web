    - Moves the cursor the previous line and before the current line's first word

Insert Character

- Insert a character at beginning of the line
- Insert a character at the end of the line
- Insert a character at the middle of the line
- Insert multiple spaces between text
- Insert tabs between / start / end of the line

Insert Line

- Insert a new line by doing enter key

- Insert a new line by keeping the cursor in the middle of the line
    - Move the content of the current line next to the cursor to the new line created next to it
- Multiple empty lines

Cursor movements:

- Left arrow moves the cursor to one position left in the current line

can we do auto line breaks in render level?
not possible because of line's dependencies for mouse and cursor movement
only create new pre tag if user made line break is seen
otherwise render everthing in a new

hard line break is mandatory here - can we handle this correctly?
whenever a line's content is overflowed - unlink overflowed character from the line - insert it to the beginning of the next line - if the next line is overflowed because of the character's inserted - unlink the overflowed characters of the next line - do this until the no-more line's are overflowing

problems in auto line break logic - handle onresize the editor container - unless user created a new line, always collapse the overflowed letters
back to it's original line if the space is available for them - one weird error when we cross 5th line - perfect rendering part, i see in some lines one character is overflowing the container for few seconds
and settling to nextline's head
